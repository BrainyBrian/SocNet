# SocNet
SocNet is no longer open source due to increasing numbers of downloads that stripped my credits. Use SocNet at socnet.16mb.com . SocNet was completely built by Dhruv Gramopadhye. Pull requests will not be considered.

# NEWS!!
On Sunday, Febuary 21, 2015, I plan to release SocNet to the -wild- open source community! Pulls and commits will work!

As of now, the basic skelton of SocNet is secure. I may use BountySource Salt to fund development of SocNet. SocNet will be free to download and fork and customise, so long as the footer is intact and a link is given to this repo and http://dgramop.co on the index (landing) page.

I am planning a few updates:
1st update: Features like Profile Pic, Facial Recognition (Through API), image upload bugfixes

2nd update: Plugin Capbilities (Fun eh?). SocNet could become an online API where you curl my server... No big plans on this one.

Pull requests will be considered on the new Qenilow
