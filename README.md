# SocNet
Just another Social Network. EXCEPT This one is open-source, so you can call it your own for that college application.

This Social Network sits on PHP (Just like Facebook), JS, CSS, and of course HTML (Asked a non coder for full-form, he said "How To Manipulate Lanterns")

I will happily except pull requests, new wiki pages etc.
