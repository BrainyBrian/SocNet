# SocNet
SocNet is no longer open source. Use SocNet at socnet.16mb.com . SocNet was completely built by Dhruv Gramopadhye. Pull requests will not be considered.

#NEWS!!
After 2 major updates to the private SocNet, SocNet will become OPEN SOURCE! It's main purpose will be to provide a template to allow other developers to write plugins around SocNet to customise their own SocNet! Due to the renaming of SocNet, there will be a new public repository with a different name either on GitHub -OR- BitBucket. 

1st update: Features like Profile Pic, Facial Recognition, image upload bugfixes

2nd update: Plugin Capbilities. SocNet may become an online API where you curl my server, or we will go as far as to allowing you to use the whole repo.

Pull requests will be considered on the new Qenilow
